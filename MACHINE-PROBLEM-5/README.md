# **Machine Problem: Object Detection and Recognition using YOLO.**


## **Objective:**
To implement real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model and gain hands-on
experience in loading pre-trained models, processing images, and visualizing results.

1. Model Loading: Use TensorFlow to load a pre-trained YOLO model.
2. Image Input: Select an image that contains multiple objects.
3. Object Detection: Feed the selected image to the YOLO model to detect various objects within it.
4. Visualization: Display the detected objects using bounding boxes and class labels.
5. Testing: Test the model on at least three different images to compare its performance and
observe its accuracy.
6. Performance Analysis: Document your observations on the model's speed and accuracy, and
discuss how YOLO’s single-pass detection impacts its real-time capabilities.

YOLOv3, trained on the COCO dataset, is known to predict with very high accuracy very wide ranges of object classes across various categories. In fact, the YOLOv3 model finds excellence in detecting real-time objects: it is a great choice for those tasks that require speed and precision. On average, YOLOv3 processes each image within about 1.48 seconds, managing fast inference against high accuracy. Its architecture enables it to detect more objects in one image. The performances of versatile applications include surveillance, autonomous driving, and image recognition systems.
