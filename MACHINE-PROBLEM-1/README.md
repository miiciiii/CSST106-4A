# **Introduction to Computer Vision**

when it comes to the application of computer vision in artificial intelligence for machine. It's about pulling out vital data from an image or images automatically and taking the sense of it. The end goal of computer vision is to replicate the capabilities of human vision so that machines can recognize objects, understand their surroundings and make decisions using visual inputs. These networks are passed through multiple stages for visual data processing, including; preprocessing the column values of entered pictures (color bits), extracting potential properties from those images and making a decision:

* **Image Acquisition:** A key component of the machine vision (MV) workflow is image acquisition, which involves hardware such as cameras, encoders, and sensors. Since machine vision systems evaluate the collected digital picture rather than the actual item, accurate photographs are crucial to the workflow. Accurate descriptions are produced using photo-sensitive sensors, which translate light waves into electrical information. To make important elements easily visible to the camera, the objective is to increase contrast for such features.

* **Preprocessing:** Image pre-processing is a process that improves the quality and information extracted from digital images before they are analyzed by computer vision or machine learning algorithms. It involves operations like noise reduction, image resizing, contrast enhancement, and image normalization. These techniques enhance the reliability and quality of subsequent tasks, such as object detection, classification, or recognition.

* **Feature Extraction:** Feature extraction is the backbone of computer vision. It involves the identification and extraction of important patterns or features from images or videos. These features act as distinctive characteristics that help algorithms classify between different objects or elements within the visual data.

* **Decision-Making:** By leveraging deep learning techniques, computers can analyze vast amounts of visual data and extract meaningful insights. This enables decision-makers to make informed choices based on visual information, leading to more accurate and efficient decision-making processes.

# **Role of Image Processing in AI**

Image processing is an essential part of computer vision and a crucial stage for AI systems in grasping visual information. It covers a wide range of operations which from basic use of image such as enhance, manipulate to advance filtering and analytics to derive value information. It is helpful to do image processing because

* **Quality improvement:** It modifies the brightness and contrast, eliminates noise… This allows ai systems to better understand it.

* **Modification:** Operations like geometric transformations (scaling, rotation) and filtering on the image are employed to make it suitable for analysis by removing any need of additional attention from human in areas of interest.

Image processing techniques such as segmentation, edge detection help AI systems to disintegrate complex images into evident components which becomes easier for recognition of object/pattern.

# **Overview of Image Processing Techniques**

Image processing involves several techniques that are essential for extracting valuable information from images. Here are three core techniques:
1. Image Enhancement

    The process of improving image quality by enhancing aspects such as resolution, reducing artifacts, and increasing quantitative accuracy, often using AI techniques like deep neural networks to transform low-quality images into high-quality ones.

    * Gaussian filtering is a linear smoothing filter that eliminates Gaussian noise and is widely used in the noise reduction process of image processing. In general, Gaussian filtering is a process of weighted averaging of the entire image.
    * A Sobel filter, in the context of Computer Science, is a type of filter that is used for edge detection in images. It is defined by a specific matrix or window size, such as 3x3 or 5x5, and is applied to the image to highlight the edges by calculating the gradient intensity.

    **Role in AI: Filtering helps AI systems by preprocessing images to remove unwanted noise, making it easier to extract meaningful features for further analysis.**

2. Image Restoration

      The process of recovering an image from a degraded version—usually a blurred and noisy image. Image restoration is a fundamental problem in image processing, and it also provides a testbed for more general inverse problems.

    **Role in AI: Image restoration techniques play a critical role in improving the quality of images used in AI systems. By restoring degraded images, AI models can perform more accurate analysis and make better predictions. This is particularly important in applications like medical imaging, where accurate reconstruction of images is essential for diagnosis, and in satellite imagery, where high-quality images are crucial for analysis and interpretation**

3. Image Compression

   a process applied to a graphics file to minimize its size in bytes without degrading image quality below an acceptable threshold. By reducing the file size, more images can be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space.

    **Role in AI: Image compression is essential for managing large volumes of image data efficiently. It enables faster storage, retrieval, and processing of images, which is crucial for AI systems that handle vast amounts of visual data. Compressed images can be transmitted more quickly over networks and processed with reduced computational resources, facilitating real-time applications such as video surveillance and streaming. Additionally, it helps in optimizing storage and reducing costs associated with data management.**



# **Facial Recognition in Smart Phone**

**How Image Processing is Used:**

1. Preprocessing:
    * Face Detection - The very first step, while recognizing a facial image, involves face detection. Essentially, the task is performed using the Viola-Jones algorithm or other modern methods like Haar cascades and Deep Learning based detectors such as MTCNN.

    * Normalization - if a face is detected, the image is normalized by changing the lighting, scaling, and rotation to ensure uniformity across images.

2. Feature Extraction
    * Key Point Detection - One of the important tasks in face analysis is to detect key locations on a person's face e.g., eyes, nose and mouth. These features are extracted by techniques such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), or increasingly, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

    * Embedding Generation - The extracted features are converted to an embedding, a compact vector that encapsulates the identity of the face.

3. Face Matching
    * comparison - The generated face embedding is compared with the embeddings stored in a database on the smartphone. Pipeline to compare faces between two images using similarity measures like Euclidean distance or cosine-similarity.
4. Decision Making:
    * Authentication - Using the similarity score, system decides to authenticate or not. When used to authenticate the user, thresholds are set so as to minimize False Positives (i.e., a threshold too low preventing an unauthorized person from being identified) or False Negatives.


**Effectiveness**

* Today, facial recognition on smartphones is incredibly good the best of it has been able to show near perfect accuracy in a controlled environment. Nonetheless, they still struggle with poor lighting conditions, facial expressions, and obstructions like glasses or masks

``` python
  import cv2
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  
  image = cv2.imread('face.jpg')
  
  gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
  
  blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray_image, (5, 5), 0)
  
  edges = cv2.Canny(blurred_image, 100, 200)
  
  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
  
  plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
  plt.title('Original Image')
  plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
  
  plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
  plt.title('Grayscale Image')
  plt.imshow(gray_image, cmap='gray')
  
  plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
  plt.title('Edge Detection')
  plt.imshow(edges, cmap='gray')
  
  plt.show()
```

# Emerging Form of Image Processing:

YOLO is a deep learning technique for real-time object detection, processing the entire image in a single pass through a convolutional neural network. It balances accuracy and speed, making it suitable for time-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and robotics.
